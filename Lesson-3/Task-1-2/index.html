            One of my favourite books is 'The Old Man and the Sea' by Ernest Hemingway. The fisherman Santiago 
            is very devoted to 
            the sea where he has been fishing since his early days. He has always been prepared for the battle
            with a big fish. aren't 

            The battle is dangerous and hard but the old man morally wins the battle. 
            His words 'man can be destroyed but not defeated' are the main idea of Hemingway's masterpiece. 
            This book inspires me greatly especially at the most difficult moments of my life. Isn't it the 
            value of literature? aren't
